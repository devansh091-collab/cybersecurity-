Password Complexity Evaluation and Best Practices


1. Created 10 passwords with varying complexity.

	  I. Password123 
	 II. Admin@123
	III. @dmin@$123
	 IV. P@$$word142536
	  V. P@$$word@$142536
	 VI. L@b!748596Ok
	VII. KaPqMz@%147369
       VIII. QAZplm)(!@#789123
	 IX. {}<>PqAlMz159753@$^*)
 	  X. !#%&(+CBdjEi/951753456258

2. On the Second step verify the password with strength on the online Tool Howsecureismypassword the link given below.

	- Link = https://howsecureismypassword.net/
	- screenshot is given on the folder.

3. Actual results of Password strength after checking the password in online tool.


		pass				Strength     		Time to Crack
						
	  I. Password123                  	very Week		Less Then Second
	 II. Admin@123				very Week		48 Minutes
	III. @dmin@$123				Week			3 Hours
	 IV. P@$$word142536			very Week		9 Seconds
	  V. P@$$word@$142536			week			3 Hours
	 VI. L@b!748596Ok			Good			2 Months
	VII. KaPqMz@%147369			Good			2 Years
       VIII. QAZplm)(!@#789123			Strong			Centuries
	 IX. {}<>PqAlMz159753@$^*)		Strong			Centuries
 	  X. !#%&(+CBdjEi/951753456258		Strong			Centuries 

4. Tips to create Strong Password so our systems are secure from Hackers(2025)

	1. Minimum 16–20+ characters
	2. Use passphrases (4+ random words) long length and more complexity
	3. Never use common patterns to create password. (Password123, Admin@123, @dmin@123, etc.)
	4. Add 1–2 numbers/symbols only if the password is already long.
	5. Never reuse passwords across sites because it use it for there use.
	6. Always use a password manager (Bitwarden, 1Password, KeePass, etc.)
	7. Enable 2FA wherever possible.

5.  Common password attacks (brute force, dictionary).

	- Brute-force: Tries every possible combo → 10–100 billion guesses/sec Then 8-char password cracked in minutes.

	- Dictionary: Checks billions of real leaked passwords “password”, “admin”, “123456” = instantly.

	- Hybrid: Dictionary + common tricks (!, 123, 2025, @ instead of a) → kills 90% of users in seconds.

	- Credential stuffing: Takes your email + password leaked from another site → logs in automatically → most common real-world hack.


6. FINAL SUMMARY: How complexity affects security

	password security is no longer about complexity 
	- it’s about length, uniqueness, and randomness. 
	- The single most effective factor is length: every character beyond 16 multiplies cracking time exponentially, 
	  making 20–30 character passwords practically unbreakable even against nation-state attackers. 
	- Short “complex” passwords full of @, !, 0, and 2025 are cracked in seconds because they follow predictable patterns already in massive hybrid dictionaries. 
	- Substitutions like P@ssw0rd! are useless. 
	- True security comes from either fully random 25–60 character strings generated by a password manager or long, unique passphrases made of 4–6 random words plus one number and 	  symbol (e.g., “!#%&(+CBdjEi/951753456258”). 
	- Anything ever leaked, reused, or based on a real word or keyboard pattern is already compromised via credential stuffing.
