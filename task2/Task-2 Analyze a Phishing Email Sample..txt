				  dkim=none (message not signed) header.d=none;dmarc=temperror action=none 								    			 	 		  header.from=atendimento.com.br;compauth=fail reason=001

	- A suspicious email was analyzed to determine whether it was a phishing attempt. The sender address banco.bradesco@atendimento.com.br
 	  was identified as fake, as Banco Bradesco’s legitimate format uses {first}.{last}@bradesco.com.br.

	- Email header analysis (using EML Analyzer and MXToolbox) revealed IP and domain mismatches, with the sender IP 137.184.34.4 not belonging to Bradesco. The extracted malicious URL 	  https://blog1seguimentmydomaine2bra.me/ and related domains appeared abnormal.

	- Authentication checks showed SPF fail, DKIM none, and DMARC temperror, confirming the email failed essential security validations. VirusTotal scans showed no detections, likely 	  because the domain was recently created, but its behavior and indicators classify it as malicious.
